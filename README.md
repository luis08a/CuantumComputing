# complexNumLib
A library made to work with complex numbers.

### Library description

This is a library made to deal with complex numbers oerations, like the sum, product, divition or the convertion between cartesian and polar representation.

---
### Library content. 
- Complex object
> You must create an complex object to perform the operations covered in the libarary. This object has two attributes, a real part an imaginary part.
- Complex operations
> The library has the following operations:
> - The conjugate of a complex number.
> - Addition between two complex numbers.
> - Difference between two complex numbers.
> - Product between two complex numbers.
> - Division between two complex numbers.
>  - The phase (or angle in polar representation).
>  - The modulus o magnitude (in polar representation).
>  - The conversion among polar and cartesian representation of complex numbers.
