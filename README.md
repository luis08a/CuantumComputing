# complexNumLib
A library made to work with complex numbers.

### Library description

This is a library made to deal with complex numbers oerations, like the sum, product, divition or the convertion between cartesian and polar representation.
Also contains the abstraction of a complex vector space, it means that you can create vectors and matrices of complex numbers and, of course, interact whit them by making matrix operations susch as scalar product, the addition between matrices and vector and more.

### Library content. 
- Complex object
> You must create an complex object to perform the operations covered in the libarary. This object has two attributes, a real part an imaginary part.
- Complex lirary operations
> Operations with complex numbers:
> - The conjugate of a complex number.
> - Addition between two complex numbers.
> - Difference between two complex numbers.
> - Product between two complex numbers.
> - Division between two complex numbers.
>  - The phase (or angle in polar representation).
>  - The modulus o magnitude (in polar representation).
>  - The conversion among polar and cartesian representation of complex numbers.

> Operations with complex matrices:
> - Addition between two complex matrices.
> - Inverse of a complex matrix.
> - Difference between two complex numbers.
> - Matrix scalar product.
> - Product between two complex matrices.
> - Matrix tranpose.
> - Matrix adjoint.
> - Matrix conjugate.
> - Matrix norm.
> - Distance between vectors and matrices.
> - Show if the matrix is Hermitian.
> - Show if the matrix is Unitary.
> - The tensor product of tow matrices.
